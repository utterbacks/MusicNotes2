# MusicNotes2

This is my first web app in production after taking Colt Steele's webdev bootcamp on Udemy. 

Its purpose is for private music instructors to be able to make notes in-lesson and create reminders for their students
on what to practice. It's a pretty minimal API designed to be used for an individual studio, but I hope to some day expand 
it into something that could be used by entire music school systems (eg. School of Rock). 

Thanks for checking out my source code. You can see the website in the wild here: ###
